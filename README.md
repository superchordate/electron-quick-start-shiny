# Attribution and More Info

`main.js` was copied from https://github.com/COVAIL/electron-quick-start on 6/29/2024 and then modified. It was not forked due to the repo being large and buggy as a result of full R installations being included in the repo. Big thanks to [COVAIL](https://github.com/COVAIL) for the head start!
